# Welcome to My Test Post

This is a sample post created to test my Jekyll site. Here's a quick summary of what I am testing:

- **Markdown Rendering**: Ensuring proper formatting for headings, lists, and more.
- **Permalink Structure**: Verifying the post URL.
- **Site Functionality**: Confirming everything works as expected.

## Sample Code

Here's a code block for testing syntax highlighting:

```ruby
def hello_world
  puts 'Hello, world!'
end
